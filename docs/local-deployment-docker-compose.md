# Local Deployment with Docker Compose

This guide describes how to run the Semantic Hub and all of its dependencies
locally with Docker Compose, as an alternative to the Helm/minikube deployment
described in [INSTALL.md](../INSTALL.md). The [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)
at the repository root bundles the same services the Helm chart deploys:

| Service        | Image                          | Purpose                                            | Host port |
|----------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| `semantic-hub` | `semantic-hub:local` (built)   | The Semantic Hub backend                           | 4242      |
| `graphdb`      | `jena-fuseki-docker:5.0.0`     | Apache Jena Fuseki triple store (persistent, TDB2) | 3030      |

## Prerequisites

- Docker with the Compose plugin (`docker compose version` ≥ 2.x)
- `curl` and `unzip` for building the Fuseki image

Maven and a JDK are **not** required on the host — the Semantic Hub is built
inside a multi-stage Docker build.

## Step 1: Build the Fuseki image

The triple store image is not published on a public registry and must be built
locally once (same precondition as for the Helm deployment):

```bash
curl -LO https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/jena/jena-fuseki-docker/5.0.0/jena-fuseki-docker-5.0.0.zip
unzip jena-fuseki-docker-5.0.0.zip
cd jena-fuseki-docker-5.0.0
docker build --build-arg JENA_VERSION=5.0.0 -t jena-fuseki-docker:5.0.0 .
cd ..
```

Verify the image exists:

```bash
docker image ls jena-fuseki-docker
```

## Step 2: Build and start the stack

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This builds the Semantic Hub image from [backend/Dockerfile](../backend/Dockerfile)
(Maven build inside the container, first run takes a few minutes) and starts:

- **graphdb** — Fuseki with a persistent TDB2 dataset `/ds`, started with
  `--tdb2 --update --loc databases/ /ds` (same arguments as the Helm chart).
  Data is persisted in the named Docker volume `fuseki-data`.
- **semantic-hub** — connected to Fuseki via `HUB_TRIPLE_STORE_BASE_URL=http://graphdb:3030/ds`.
  Authentication is disabled via the `local` Spring profile, exactly like the
  Helm chart does when `hub.authentication=false`.

## Step 3: Verify the deployment

Wait until both containers are up and the hub is healthy:

```bash
docker compose ps
curl http://localhost:4242/actuator/health
```

Expected output: `{"status":"UP", ...}`.

The hub needs a moment to start (the Helm probes allow ~100 s); follow the
logs if it is not ready yet:

```bash
docker compose logs -f semantic-hub
```

## Step 4: Use the API

- **Swagger UI**: <http://localhost:4242/>
- **API base URL**: `http://localhost:4242/api/v1`
- **Fuseki SPARQL endpoint** (direct triple store access): `http://localhost:3030/ds`

Example — upload an aspect model and read it back:

```bash
# Create a minimal SAMM aspect model
curl -X POST "http://localhost:4242/api/v1/models?type=SAMM&status=DRAFT" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  --data-binary @- <<'EOF'
@prefix samm: <urn:samm:org.eclipse.esmf.samm:meta-model:2.2.0#> .
@prefix : <urn:samm:org.example:1.0.0#> .

:MyAspect a samm:Aspect ;
   samm:preferredName "My Aspect"@en ;
   samm:properties ( ) ;
   samm:operations ( ) ;
   samm:events ( ) .
EOF

# List all models
curl "http://localhost:4242/api/v1/models"
```

## Step 5: Tear down

```bash
docker compose down          # stop containers, keep triple store data
docker compose down -v       # stop containers and delete the Fuseki data volume
```

## Optional: In-memory triple store instead of Fuseki

For a quick, non-persistent setup you can use the hub's embedded triple store
and skip Fuseki entirely (equivalent to `hub.embeddedTripleStore=true` in the
Helm chart). Set in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  semantic-hub:
    environment:
      HUB_TRIPLE_STORE_EMBEDDED_ENABLED: "true"
```

and start only the hub: `docker compose up -d --build semantic-hub`.
All data is lost when the container restarts.

## Troubleshooting

- **`pull access denied for jena-fuseki-docker`** — the Fuseki image was not
  built locally; repeat step 1.
- **Hub logs connection errors to `graphdb`** — Fuseki may still be starting;
  the hub recovers once Fuseki is reachable. Check `docker compose logs graphdb`.
- **Port already in use** — adjust the host-side port mappings (`4242`, `3030`)
  in `docker-compose.yml`.
